Welcome to AckFUSS!

Lua 5.1 is required to run AckFUSS. If it is not already installed on your
server, it can be downloaded and compiled, freely, from www.lua.org. You may
have to edit the include in ack.h and the linker options in the Makefile to
point to where you have installed your copy of Lua, if it is not the same.

Now that you've successfully untarred the mud, you'll want to do a few
things to help you along.  In the /src dir, there are some adjustments you
will want to make:  The h/config.h file contains user customizable strings,
take a look.

Edit the port number in your startup script for the port you want to use
for your mud.

If you are familiar with the IMC config file, you may hand edit it, or you
can configure it once online.

Once you have edited h/config.h cd to your /src dir, and type make.  You should
get a clean make, with no errors _or_ warnings...if not, please let Kline know
of any problems. Once your make is complete, again from the /src dir, type:
./startup &

You will get a message, hit return.  Your mud should now be running!
Telnet to the address and port of your mud, and connect with any name of
your choosing. The first user created will be auto-set to max level with
full admin privileges. After this, to create other immortals, you will need
to setclass them to the appropriate level and grant them trust.

Enjoy AckFUSS, please be sure to notify Kline with any errors/bugs, and
consider our web site: http://www.ackmud.net as a source of information.
