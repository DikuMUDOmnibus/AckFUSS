Welcome to AckFUSS and the Halls of the Immortals!
 
Official support for AckFUSS is provided at www.ackmud.net
You can also find areas, snippets, and the latest code releases there!
 
I'm also reachable via the included IMC2 network as Kline@AF -- that is the core dev
MUD for AckFUSS. Give me a shout or feel free to drop by!
 
The city of Calor starts what I would recommend for "usable" vnums. I'm trying to keep
all vnums <= 1000 for system/imm use and expansion. So if you build a zone in that range,
expect it to possibly conflict with future AckFUSS core areas. Feel free to create a large
filler area to block that range if you need to make it easier to use makearea in the time
being though!
