EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  The amount of exp
you need to gain a level is determined by your race.  To gain a level, use
the GAIN command.

You gain experience by:
    Being part of a group that kills a monster,
    or by killing monsters on your own.
You lose experience by:
    Fleeing from combat
    Recalling out of combat
    Being the target of certain spells
    Dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.
