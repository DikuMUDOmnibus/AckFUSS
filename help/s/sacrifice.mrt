SACRIFICE

SACRIFICE will destroy a corpse or object in the room, possibly granting a
small sum of money, experience, or a small bonus. You may simply "sacrifice <item>"
or you can sacrifice "Good", "Neutral", "Evil", or "Judge". Sacrificing to
one of the alignments will attempt to shift your character's alignment
closer to that alignment, ie, sacrificing evil items to "good" will make
you turn good.

Sacrificing to the Judge is necessary to clear a wanted flag should you
acquire one by breaking the law (stealing or PVPing, usually).
