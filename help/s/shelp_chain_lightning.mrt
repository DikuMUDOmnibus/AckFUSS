Description: This spell allows the caster to produce a powerful bolt of
             energy from his/her fingertip.  The bolt will proceed to fly
             through the current location, striking all present randomly.
             The bolt will then either vanish, or return to strike the
             caster!  Each time a victim is struck, the bolt's energy is
             reduced, as is it's ability to damage.
