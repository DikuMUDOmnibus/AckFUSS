SNOOP

Snoop allows you to watch the actions of a player as if they were your
own. This is very useful for checking errors or understanding the output
a player is seeing in troubleshooting; it can also be used to monitor
cheating. This is highly invasive of player privacy however, and should
be used with the utmost care.
