AUTOBRIEF

The autobrief command is used as a shortcut to config +/-autobrief. With autobrief
enabled you will stop seeing room descriptions and the automapper when traveling.
This helps reduce the amount of data sent to your client and speeds up long distance
speed walking. With autobrief disabled, rooms will always display normally.
