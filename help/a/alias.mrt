ALIAS

The ALIAS command allows you configure the six alias 'slots'.  An alias
takes the form of a name, and the alias.  To set up a new alias, type:
ALIAS <slot_number> <name> <alias>

For example:
ALIAS 2 ban emote turns into a banana and splits...

Now, whenever you type 'ban' the mud checks through the command table.  If
your input wasn't found, it then checks your alias.  Upon matching 'ban'
it issues the alias to the interpreter function, along with any argument
you typed after the alias name.

For example, you can define an alias:
ALIAS 1 ff cast 'faerie fire'

and then use it on mobs by typing:
ff <target_name>.

So typing 'ff stephen' will cause the mud to interpret
cast faerie fire stephen.

To show what aliases are set, type ALIAS with no arguements.
To clear an alias, type 'ALIAS <number> clear'.
