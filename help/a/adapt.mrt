ADAPT

ADAPT allows you to have a weapon adapted for your use, if it's level is higher
than yours.  Adapt can only be used when in the room with a NPC that offers
his/her services for adapting.  Typing ADAPT with no argument reports the cost
of having a weapon adapted.

Once the weapon has been adapted, its damage will have been lowered in line
with the decrease in the weapon's level to your's.  Any affects on the weapon
(Eg affects HITROLL) will be heavily reduced, and probably cancelled.

If, once a weapon has been adapted, it's attributes indicate it will cause NO
damage, it will crumble into dust, and you will lose it.
