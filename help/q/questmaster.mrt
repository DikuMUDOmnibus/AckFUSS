MQUEST QUESTMASTER

Mquest is an alternative system to simply grinding out experience on hundreds
of mobs to level and get gold. It's also a side alternative to the regularly
run 'crusade' quests. Mquest's are automatically scaled to your level, both
in difficulty and reward potential.

There are five mquest commands:
mquest request         - Gets a quest if a questmaster mob is in the room.
mquest giveup          - Abandons a quest. This has a slight penalty.
mquest info            - Display the relevant information about the quest.
mquest complete        - Hands in the quest if a questmaster mob is in the room.
mquest hint #          - Gives a hint for task # in your quest list.

There are six types of quests you can receive:
item retrieval         - Retrieve a certain # of a certain item.
multi-item retrieval   - Retrieve a certain # of numerous items.
creature killing       - Hunt down and destroy a certain # of a mob.
multi-creature killing - Hunt down and destroy a certian # of numerous mobs.
race killing           - Hunt down and destroy a certain # of a race.
multi-race killing     - Hunt down and destroy a certain # of numerous races.
