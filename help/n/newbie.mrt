NEWBIE

As a new player to Shades of Evil, there are several things that you will
need to know.  First off, it's important to understand that this is a
multiclass mud...you are, right now, a member of 5 classes.  When it comes
time to level your character, you can find the guildmasters in the players
area, west of the temple/recall.  Type help GAIN to find out about
leveling your character.

Here are some important helps that you need to read:
        HELP COLOR
        COLOR HELP
        HELP DEATH
        HELP TRAIN
        WORTH

Here's a couple more things about Shades of Evil that are handy to know:
        Recalls are free, just type "recall"
        There is no rent here, just "save" and "quit"
        There are NO DEATHTRAPS on SoE...we hate them.
        There ARE item level limits...it's the only way we have right now
          to control item flow among characters.
        Your colors are completely configurable, read COLOR HELP.
        -and, last by not least-
        The Immortals are here to help you!  Ask them questions! (Politely!)
