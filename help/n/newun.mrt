As a new player, you're advised to check out Mudschool, where you will start
off in the game.  You'll be able to get hold off some basic equipment, as
well some experience points!  Remember, you must get to level 2, in order
to be able to save your character.
 Type WORTH to see how much experience points are needed to gain a level.
If you've played Merc Muds before, type 'HELP CHANGES' to see what makes
this different.
