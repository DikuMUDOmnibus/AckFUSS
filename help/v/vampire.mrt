VAMPIRE

@@dVampires, creatures of legend?  Perhaps....perhaps not.
Centuries ago, there were four creatures that decended upon the world.
These creatures were called Methuselahs.  Their evil was spread to
others of the world, by shear force of will, leaving those newly 
initiated "Nosferatu" without a clue as to their new nature...what they
were, how they became that way, why they lust...
For generations, the will of the Methuselah was obeyed to the letter,
until they disappeared from the world, taking the children that they
initiated, and those children's children, with them.  Nothing was
left for the Nosferatu to study from, no information, no divine "truth".
Centuries later, it is believed that the Methuselah have returned,
spreading their evil anew.  Reports have been told worldwide of a Chapel
where their evil is felt...the wind in the spires of the Chapel whispers
the word "m e t h u s e l a h".
Legend has it that the spirits of the original Methuselah haunt
the halls of this Chapel, waiting to take control of mortal (immortal?)
bodies, and walk the world once again....@@g
