RECALL

RECALL will pray for transport back to your home. RECALL may
not work while fighting and uses your defensive cooldown. On
a successful recall you will lose a portion of your total
experience, but the amount is less than had you died. Also,
some rooms or spells may prevent recall -- be warned!

'/' is a synonym for recall.
