CLAN CLANS

This is a help file on clans; what they are, what they do, and how they do
it :)

First, Clans are groups of characters who help each other out on Shades of
Evil.  Undoubtedly, there will be some clan rivalry, but, hopefully, this
will not become too extreme :)  For you, the player, to join a clan, you
need to get ahold of the clan leader of the clan you want to join...he
or she can accept you into the clan -- if they decide you belong in the 
fold.

Clan commands:
	@@yCWHERE	CDONATE	HOME	CLAN	LEAVE@@g

Clan Job commands ( Armourer, Diplomat, Leader, Treasurer, and Boss):
	@@yACCEPT	BANISH	MAKE	CTOGGLE	NEGOTIATE@@g	

See the help files on the above commands for more info.
