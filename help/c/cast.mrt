CAST

Casting a spell takes time. The time to cast varies from spell to spell, and
can be seen with the "spells" commands. To stop a spell mid-cast you can use the
"stop" command, move, or recall. While casting you are unable to perform melee
attacks in battle, and any damage suffered from combat will slow your casting
progress in the form of "knockback".

Certain races have an innate ability to cast more quickly, and there may be items
or spells in-game that also reduce your casting speed.
