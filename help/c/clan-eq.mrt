CLAN-EQ

This is a help page for Clan Leaders devloping new equipment for their clan.
If you are not involved with this process, then there's not much here to
interest you.

If you are developing Clan Equipment, please note that you _must_ follow
these guidelines, if you wish your equipment to be considered legal.  You
will NOT be allowed to load any illegal equipment using the 'MAKE' command.

Each Clan may have 4 Pieces of equipment.  Each must be of different wear
locations.  You may not make staffs, wands, pills, scrolls, etc.  The only
equipment you can make are weapons, containers, or armor.

You have 'points' that you may distribute among the objects you make.
For 2 of the objects, you will have 20 points.  For the other 2, you will 10

Points are used to 'buy' stats on the object as follows:

So, to 'buy' An -20 AC affect would cost 12 points.  It doesn't mean you
get ALL the entries for a given price!

Limitation:   You can only have a maximum of 3 different affects on each
              object.

If you think your objects are legal, contact Stephen, who will check them.
If he agrees they are valid, they will be added to your clan equipment, and
leaders of your clan will be able to load them for their members.
