COOLDOWN

Every ability has a cooldown, there are two categories: offensive and defense.
Abilities that harm another are classified offensive, those that don't are
defensive. While a cooldown is active, you are unable to use any other abilities
from that cooldown category. Some skills will place you on cooldown longer than
others, so be careful!
