BUILD HELP : DOORS
------------------

Uh-oh.  I don't know exactly _how_ doors are handled by the builder.  I'm
still working this one out myself.  As far as i know, this method seems to
work:

set the door as type door, and as closed, locked or pickproof, as needed.
Add a reset to close/lock the door.

Make sure you set both sides of the door.
