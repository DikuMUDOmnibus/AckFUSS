BUILD

The build command loads up the online creator (OLC) to create or edit new
areas, mobs, and objects. Once in the builder it has its own set of helpfiles
and commands. You can exit the builder with 'stop' and escape (send commands
outside the builder while building) the builder with a colon, ':'.

IE: To talk on 'gossip' while building, you would use :gossip <msg>.
