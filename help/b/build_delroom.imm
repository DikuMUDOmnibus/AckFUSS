BUILD HELP : DELROOM
--------------------

The DELROOM command allows you to delete a room.
Syntax:  DELROOM <room-vnum>

If the room-vnum is found in your current area, and no one is currently in it,
the room will be flagged for deletion, and you will be asked to enter DELROOM OK
to actually delete it.
