BUILD HELP : USING THE EDITOR
-----------------------------

Using the editor, it is possible to edit any strings you need.  The most 
common of these will be room descriptions.

To enter the editor, enter '$edit' as the string.  So, in Redit mode:
'desc $edit'  will allow you to edit the room's description.

To format the string, type '.f'
To see what other options are available, type '.h'
To finish editing a string, type '.'
