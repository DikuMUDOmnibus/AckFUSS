BUILD HELP : AOBJ
------------------
Aobj, or auto-object, is available to rapidly set gear stats based on a table and absolute
maximum values.

These stats can be raw derived from max by just using 'aobj', or further refined based on
slot by using 'aobj <slot>'. Currently tab_auto_object contains the modifiers to be changed
in buildtab.c, but this may move to being online-editable in the future. You can use 'aobj list'
to see all valid slots.
