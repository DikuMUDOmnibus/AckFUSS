BUILD HELP : GOTO
-----------------

The GOTO command allows you to goto either a room or a mob.
Sytntax:    [For Rooms]   GOTO <room-vnum>
            [For  Mobs]   GOTO <mob-name>

At Present, the builder's goto command simply calls the Immortal's goto.
This will be changed shortly, to reduce the chance of abuse.
