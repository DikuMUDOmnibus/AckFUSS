BUILD HELP : MEDIT
------------------

The MEDIT command places you in Mobile EDITing mode.
Syntax:  MEDIT [mob-vnum]

This will allow you to edit information concerning mobiles.  To set which mobile
you wish to work on, either enter a mob-vnum after MEDIT, or use the SETVNUM
command.  Anything you type will be checked to see if it applies to mobiles,
and if so, the value, flag or string specified will be set.
