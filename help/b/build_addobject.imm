BUILD HELP : ADDOBJECT
----------------------

The ADDOBJECT command allows you to create new objects within the current area.
Syntax:  ADDOBJECT <object-vnum> <name>

This will add a new object with the specified vnum, and with the specified
name (which you can always change later).  The object will not be added if
there is already an object with the vnum you supply.
