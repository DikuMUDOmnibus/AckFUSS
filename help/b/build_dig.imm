BUILD HELP : DIG
----------------

The DIG command allows you to add a room to an area.
Syntax:  DIG <direction> <room-vnum>

This will add an exit in the direction given,  to the room you are currently in,
connected to a new room, which will have the vnum specified.  There are two
obvious limitations:  There can't already be a door in the direction you give,
or a room that already has the vnum you give.
