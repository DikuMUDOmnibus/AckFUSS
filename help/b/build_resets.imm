BUILD HELP : RESETS
-------------------

Each area typically consists of Rooms, Objects and Mobiles.  Rooms 'appear'
almost automatically, but for your objects and mobiles to be loaded requires
the use of RESETS.  Using the builder, you can add resets to rooms, to do such
operations as loading mobiles, equiping mobiles with objects, randomising
exits, etc.
