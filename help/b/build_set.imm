BUILD HELP : SET
----------------

Set allows you to set some value, string or flag, depending upon which editing
mode you are currently in.  It is not really needed any more, as you can drop
the 'SET' part of the command now.  Eg: SET level 100 (when editing mobs) could
be entered as 'level 100' instead.

Typing 'SET' on it's own displays the values, flags or strings you can set.
