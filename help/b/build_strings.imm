BUILD HELP : STRINGS
--------------------

STRINGS are collections of characters: i.e. words or sentences.
The most visible parts of an area are the descriptions on mobiles, objects, 
and especially rooms.  Please try and bear some thought to how these will
look, especially for mobiles and objects that may end up out of their intended
positions.  Room descriptions should be neutral, and not too short, where
possible.
