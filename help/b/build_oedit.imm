BUILD HELP : OEDIT
------------------

The OEDIT command places you in Object EDITing mode.
Syntax:  OEDIT [object-vnum]

This will allow you to edit onformation concerning objects.  To set which object
you wish to work on, either enter an object-vnum after OEDIT, or use the SETVNUM
command.  Anything you type will be checked to see if it applies to mobiles,
and if so, the value, flag or string specified will be set.
