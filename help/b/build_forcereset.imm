BUILD HELP : FORCERESET
-----------------------

The FORCERESET command allows you to execute all resets within the current area.
Syntax:  FORCERESET

This will read through each reset, and if applicable, will load objects or mobs,
equip mobs, set door states, etc.  BE WARNED!  Any aggressive mobiles that are
loaded are just that - aggressive!  In other words you'll be a valid target, 
even if you are in building mode.
