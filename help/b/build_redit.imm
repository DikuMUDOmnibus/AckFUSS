BUILD HELP : REDIT
------------------

The REDIT command places you in Room EDITing mode.
Syntax:  REDIT

This will allow you to edit information concerning rooms.  The room you are
working on is ALWAYS the room your character is currently in.
Anything you type will be checked to see if it applies to rooms, and if so, 
the value, flag or string will be set.
