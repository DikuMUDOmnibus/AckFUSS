BANK

The BANK command allows you to carry out financial transactions with the bank 
of your choice.  All banks in the game respect a player's balance, meaning
you can use any bank you find.  

Usage: BANK [ balance | deposit | withdraw ]
BANK                 with no argument displays usage information.
BANK BALANCE         reports your current bank balance.
BANK DEPOSIT  <gold> deposits a specified amount of gold into your account.
BANK WITHDRAW <gold> withdraws a specified amount of gold.

Needless to say, you must have the specified amount of gold in your account or
inventory before you can deposit or withdraw it.
The banking system has been introduced as a measure to work alongside the new
limit on the amount of gold that a player can carry.  Eg:  How many people can
explore and fight, whilst carrying thousands of gold coins?
