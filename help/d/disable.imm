DISABLE

Disable will temporarily disable a command from use. To view currently disabled
commands, type 'disable'. To toggle a command's disabled status, use 'disable <cmd>'.

Commands are saved and persist through reboots and shutdowns. An immortal can not
disable a command with a level higher than theirs, nor re-enable a command that was
disabled by a higher level immortal.
