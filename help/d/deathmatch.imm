DEATHMATCH

The deathmatch command will start a deathmatch! This is a free for all PVP fest
where players fight till the last man standing and records (pdeaths) don't save.
The game is DM-Locked (similar to wizlock) until the DM is stopped or ended,
preventing players from logging back in to compete once they are eliminated.

See 'help dm' for the file that is displayed to players at the start of a
deathmatch.
