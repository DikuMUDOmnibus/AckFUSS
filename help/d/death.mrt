DEATH

When your character dies, your corpse is magically transported to the
Morgue of Moribound - an establishment which serves all the realms of this
land.  You are given a new body to use, and placed in the lands of
Moribound.

The only task you must complete is to get to your corpse is find your way to
the morgue - a task set as a rather sick joke by the morgue's management.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.
Following and groups are not affected by death.
You lose HALF of the experience points you have.
Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Only the player who died may take items from his/her/it's corpse.
