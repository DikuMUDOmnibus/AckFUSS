TRAIN

Syntax: train <'str'|'int'|'wis'|'dex'|'con'>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has slightly random attributes.  The maximum value for each
attribute depends on your race and class.

It costs four practice to train an attribute, except that it costs
only three practice to train your prime attribute.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practices when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.

In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train
WIS and CON both to max before practising or training anything else.

Train now reports the cost in practice points to increase an attribute.
It is also possible to spend practices on hit points or mana points.
