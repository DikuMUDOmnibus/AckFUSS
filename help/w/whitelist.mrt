WHITELIST

WHITELIST will let you restrict the domains you are allowed to login
to your character from. To activate it, use "config +whitelist", to
deactivate, use "config -whitelist". Typing "whitelist" by itself
will display your whitelist, you can add or remove sites by using
"whitelist <add/del> <site>".

Whitelist sites function the same as sitebans, only in reverse. You
may supply an IP address or a domain host. Every connection is
guaranteed to have an IP address to match against, but they may change
more frequently. Hostname lookups are performed on each connection
but may not always be successful. Wildcards are automatic if one
side of a period is left blank.

Example: allow all logins from "mydomain.com"
  whitelist add .mydomain.com

Example: allow all logins from IP address 123.456.789.123
  whitelist add 123.456.789.123

Example: allow all logins from IP block 789.456.123
  whitelist add 789.456.123.
