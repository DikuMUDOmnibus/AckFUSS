WHO

WHO displays all visible online players and immortals, as well
as the maximum player count since the last reboot. You can also
who <class abbr> such as "who cle" to see all Cleric primaries,
or "who adept" for Adepts. Who also allows you to "who group"
to see who is in grouping range, and "who imm" to only show
visible imms.
