GAIN

GAIN increases one of your levels.  Level gain is no longer automatic, due
to the 'semi' multiclass system.  Typing GAIN with no argument will report
which levels you are able to gain in, and the cost to do so (in xp).
Typing GAIN with the 3-letter abreviation for a class will advance your level
in the given class, if you can level in it, and if you have enough xp.

Eg: GAIN thi    will advance your thief level, if you are able to level thief.
