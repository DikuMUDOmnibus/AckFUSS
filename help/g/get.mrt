GET TAKE

GET will retrieve an item and place it in your inventory, if you have
space, and can hold the weight. To get an item from within a room
simply "get <item>". To take an item from inside a container (either
within the room or your inventory) use "get <item> from <container>".

TAKE is a synonym for GET.
